2. Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "HairSalon.Solution/HairSalon".
3. In the command line, run the command "dotnet run" to compile and execute the console application. After you have built/run all of your dependencies, you can publish the application to the internet by typing dotnet watch run.  This will open a web browser to LocalHost:5000 or Localhost:5001.  From here you can interact with the application. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal.
4. Optionally, you can run "dotnet build" to compile this console app without running it.
